Task 0 is on having a script that prints "Hello, World" followed by a new line to the standard output
Task 1 has us working with multiple quotes and how to escape them. I didn't know it wasn't always necessary to escape single quotes if you're going to have them on the output
Task 2 is about dispalying the contents of a file
